## Please follow instructions to have best performance on app graphql side:

---

- Create new model inside **`./models`** directory
- Define your **`typeDefs,Resolvers`** for each model and export them
- Add your **`typeDefs,Resolvers`** to `typeDefs.ts` and `Resolvers.ts`
- That's it, done, graphql will compil them as well as did before
